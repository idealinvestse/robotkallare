# Swedish TTS Options for GDial

This document outlines various options for implementing Swedish text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities in GDial, focusing on modern neural TTS models that provide high-quality speech synthesis.

## 1. Facebook MMS-TTS-SWE

**Overview:**
- Part of Meta's Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project
- VITS-based architecture (Variational Inference with adversarial learning for TTS)
- Specifically trained for Swedish language

**Pros:**
- High-quality speech synthesis
- Easy to implement via Hugging Face transformers library
- 36.3M parameters (relatively lightweight)
- Well-documented integration path
- No need for romanization since it's specifically designed for Swedish

**Cons:**
- Limited voice options (no voice selection)
- Non-deterministic output (requires seed setting for consistency)
- Requires ~500MB disk space

**Implementation:**
```python
from transformers import VitsModel, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model = VitsModel.from_pretrained("facebook/mms-tts-swe")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/mms-tts-swe")

text = "Hej, det här är ett test av svensk talsyntes."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**inputs).waveform
```

## 2. Coqui XTTS

**Overview:**
- Open-source TTS framework with multilingual capabilities
- Voice cloning capabilities (can clone a voice from a reference audio)
- Supports 1,100+ languages including Swedish

**Pros:**
- Voice cloning ability (can use any reference voice)
- Multilingual support in a single model
- Highly customizable
- Strong community support
- High-quality output

**Cons:**
- Larger model size
- More complex implementation
- Higher computational requirements
- May require fine-tuning for optimal Swedish quality

**Implementation:**
```python
# Install with: pip install TTS
from TTS.api import TTS

# Initialize TTS with multilingual XTTS model
tts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2", gpu=True)

# Generate speech with Swedish language and custom voice
output_path = tts.tts_to_file(
    text="Hej, det här är ett test av svensk talsyntes.",
    file_path="output.wav",
    speaker_wav="path/to/reference_voice.wav",
    language="sv"
)
```

## 3. KTH/STTS TTS Models

**Overview:**
- Models developed by KTH Royal Institute of Technology
- Specifically designed for Swedish language
- Multiple model variations available

**Pros:**
- Specialized for Swedish language nuances
- Good handling of Swedish-specific phonetics
- Research-backed quality

**Cons:**

- Limited documentation compared to larger projects
- May require more expertise to implement properly

## 4. Microsoft Azure TTS (Commercial API)

**Overview:**
- Commercial API with high-quality Swedish voices
- Part of Azure Cognitive Services
- Multiple voice options available for Swedish

**Pros:**
- Multiple professional Swedish voices (male/female)
- Reliable service with good uptime
- Easy API integration
- Neural voices with high naturalness

**Cons:**
- Commercial solution with usage costs
- External API dependency
- Internet connection required
- Potential privacy concerns with sending text externally

**Implementation:**
```python
import requests

# Azure TTS API call
endpoint = "https://your-resource-name.cognitiveservices.azure.com/tts/v1"
headers = {
    "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": "your-subscription-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/ssml+xml",
    "X-Microsoft-OutputFormat": "audio-16khz-128kbitrate-mono-mp3"
}
body = """
<speak version='1.0' xml:lang='sv-SE'>
    <voice name='sv-SE-SofieNeural'>
        Hej, det här är ett test av svensk talsyntes.
    </voice>
</speak>
"""

response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, data=body)
with open("output.mp3", "wb") as audio_file:
    audio_file.write(response.content)
```

## 5. VITS Swedish Models

**Overview:**
- Variant implementations of VITS architecture fine-tuned for Swedish
- Available through community repositories on Hugging Face
- Multiple variants with different training data

**Pros:**
- High-quality output
- Relatively simple integration through Hugging Face
- Open-source implementation

**Cons:**
- Varying quality depending on specific model
- Less official support
- May need evaluation to find the best variant

## Comparison of Local Implementation Options

## Recommendation

Based on the available options, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Primary Solution**: Facebook MMS-TTS-SWE
   - Easiest implementation path
   - Good quality specifically for Swedish
   - Well-supported through Hugging Face

2. **Alternative (if voice customization is critical)**: Coqui XTTS
   - More complex but offers voice cloning capabilities
   - Allows for better personalization of voice characteristics

3. **Commercial Fallback**: Microsoft Azure TTS
   - If local implementation proves challenging
   - Offers professional quality with multiple voices

## Implementation Considerations

Regardless of the chosen TTS solution, consider these implementation aspects:

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Pre-generate common phrases
   - Implement a disk-based cache with TTL
   - Monitor disk usage

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Batch processing for multiple messages
   - GPU acceleration where available
   - Asynchronous processing

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Default to Twilio TTS if local generation fails
   - Implement error handling and logging

4. **Integration with Twilio**:
   - Use the `<Play>` TwiML verb to play generated audio
   - Ensure proper URL formatting for audio files
   - Consider audio format compatibility
