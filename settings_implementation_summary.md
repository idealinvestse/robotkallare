# GDial Settings Implementation Summary

## Overview

The settings system in GDial has been enhanced with additional, high-value settings based on the recommendations. The implementation focused on the most relevant settings that would provide immediate value and integrate well with the existing system architecture.

## Implemented Changes

1. **System Settings**:
   - Added key general settings: `timezone`, `language`, `maintenance_mode`
   - Added call settings: `max_concurrent_calls`, `default_voice`, `call_recording`, `voicemail_detection`, etc.
   - Added SMS rate limit settings: `max_concurrent_sms`, `sms_rate_limit_per_second`
   - Added security-related settings: `force_https`, `sensitive_data_masking`, `auto_logout_inactive_min`

2. **DTMF Settings**:
   - Added new fields: `repeat_message_digit`, `confirm_receipt_digit`, `dtmf_menu_style`, `inter_digit_timeout`, `allow_message_skip`
   - These enhance the user experience during emergency calls

3. **SMS Settings**:
   - Added compliance fields: `allow_opt_out`, `opt_out_keyword`
   - Added performance fields: `sms_rate_limit_per_second`, `fail_silently`, `sms_retry_strategy`
   - Added feature fields: `sms_url_shortener`, `delivery_report_timeout`

4. **New Security Settings Model**:
   - Created a dedicated model for security settings
   - Includes access control: `max_login_attempts`, `password_expiry_days`
   - Includes system security: `force_https`, `sensitive_data_masking`
   - Includes API security: `api_rate_limit`, `audit_log_retention_days`
   - Includes advanced security: `require_2fa`, `ip_whitelist`, `allowed_origins`

5. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added endpoints for new SecuritySettings model
   - Updated schemas for the enhanced DTMF and SMS settings models

## Usage

The settings are initialized at application startup and can be accessed through the following functions:

```python
# In your GDial code
from app.settings import get_system_setting, get_dtmf_settings, get_sms_settings, get_notification_settings, get_security_settings
from app.database import get_session

# Get a setting value
with get_session() as session:
    # Get a system setting
    timezone = get_system_setting(session, "timezone", "UTC")  # provides default value if not set
    
    # Get object settings
    dtmf_settings = get_dtmf_settings(session)
    sms_settings = get_sms_settings(session)
    notification_settings = get_notification_settings(session)
    security_settings = get_security_settings(session)
    
    # Use the settings
    if security_settings.force_https:
        # Enforce HTTPS
        pass
```

## REST API Access

All settings are accessible through the REST API:

- `/settings/system` - System settings
- `/settings/dtmf` - DTMF settings
- `/settings/sms` - SMS settings
- `/settings/notifications` - Notification settings 
- `/settings/security` - Security settings (new)

Each endpoint supports both GET and PUT methods for retrieving and updating settings.

## Next Steps

1. **UI Integration**: The settings UI needs to be updated to display and edit the new settings.
2. **Application Code Integration**: Update various parts of the application to use the new settings.
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to include the new settings.
4. **Testing**: Test the new settings functionality thoroughly.

Additional settings from the recommendations document can be implemented in future iterations based on evolving requirements.
